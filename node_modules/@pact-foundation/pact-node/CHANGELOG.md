# [10.0.0](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-node/compare/v9.0.7...v10.0.0) (2019-10-28)

* **can-i-deploy:** Options for CanDeploy have changed. Now, pacticipants are specified by an array of { name: <string>, latest?: <string | boolean>, version?: <string> }, allowing more than one pacticipant to be specified. You must specify one of latest
or version. If latest is `true`, the latest pact is used. If it is string, then the latest pact with that tag is used.
* **CanDeploy:** CanDeploy now defaults to json output (and returns the parsed object as the result of the promise. If you were using CanDeploy and relied on parsing the logged output, you will need to explicitly set `output: table` in your CanDeploy options.
